 *
 * The profile's patch layer is the *durable* config file. The vendored Loader's
 * tree write-back targets the include root (`cordis.yml`), which the launcher
 * rewrites to an empty list on every boot (`prepareProfile`), so mutating
 * `ctx.loader` alone can never survive a restart. This module is the part that
 * actually persists.
 *
 * `js-yaml` round-trips the patch file with the same `!!js` dialect the
 * harness's own include uses, so any non-MCP patch entries are preserved
 * bit-for-bit in value (their leading comment header is kept too).
